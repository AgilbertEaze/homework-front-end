# Eaze Frontend Homework

> Our Frontend code challenge for engineering applicants

## Project

Using the Github API and your framework of choice, display a list of your public Github repos. Include the description, and sort them by number of watchers, most popular first.

## Setup

We've included an `index.html` and a `index.js` in the `client` directory to help get you started. You'll likely want to set up a local development server. This server should be started with the `npm start` command (feel free to use webpack or any other off the shelf system).

## Testing

Use whatever testing library you prefer. The tests should be run using `npm test`.
